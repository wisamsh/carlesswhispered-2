Faster & lighter experience for your users. Deliver optimized images on all platforms instantly using ImageKit.

== Description ==

Images make up a critical part of all websites and mobile applications these days. They are the centerpieces of a great product and user experience. Managing your images and delivering the perfect image, tailored and optimized for your userâ€™s device is, therefore, more critical than it has ever been. However, this takes up a lot of development and maintenance time that could have otherwise been used in building your core product. This is where ImageKit can excel.

== Frequently asked questions ==

= Do I have to register on ImageKit.io to use this module? =

Yes, you need to [create an account](https://imagekit.io/registration) on https://imagekit.io first to use this plugin.

= How does this plugin works? =

This plugin changes the HTML content of the post to replace base URL with ImageKit endpoint so that images are loaded via ImageKit.

= Do I have to manually change the old posts to optimize their images? =

No, this plugin automatically takes care of that.

= Does this plugin support custom CNAME? =

Yes, you can email developer@imagekit.io to configure custom CNAME for your account and then specify that in the plugin setting page.

= Can I configure this plugin to use ImageKit for custom upload directories? =

Yes, you can specify any number of custom directory locations on plugin settings page

= Does ImageKit support all image formats? =

ImageKit supports all popular image formats that cover 99.99% of the use case. On the settings page, you can further configure if you want to allow or disallow a particular file type to be loaded via ImageKit.

= I installed the plugin, but the ImageKit website analyzer is suggesting more optimization. =

This is because image dimensions are not as per the layout. We could have done it using Javascript in the frontend like other plugins, but we do not recommend it. The browser triggers the image load as soon as it sees an image URL in HTML and intentionally delaying this while Javascript calculates the ideal width will ultimately slow down the image load for your users. WordPress 4.4 has [added native support for a responsive image](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/10/responsive-images-in-wordpress-4-4/).
